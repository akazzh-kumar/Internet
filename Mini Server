Mini Web Image Server:

  node js for creating a server and handle requests.
  http server is used as a protocol for communication.
  ngrok is used to give a public url for use everwhere. normally we use same system or connecting same network (locally), so this uses for public.

steps:
  1. Start the service.
  2. ngrok http <port-number>
  3. ngrok gives public url, copy and paste to the browswer, then we get response.
